Hi Johnny,

You don't know me nor remember me, but you inspired me in this new adventure that I'm starting.

I browsed again your travel blog looking for ways to advertise my product and I found that you have Step4Ward Media company. Then an idea came to my mind; perhaps your company can promote my product, Wish To Go. I've seen that you work with other travel bloggers and I think this product can be of their interest. Let me explain.

Wish To Go is a plugin for Travel Blogs that shows a heart ❤️ next to the posts headers or in the article text. The readers can click on them as they do on Instagram pictures. When the reader clicks on the heart, the destination described in the post is added to a reader's personal destination wish list. This is the same idea of Amazon wish lists. Wish lists feature has been implemented in Booking.com or Airbnb as well because they are a great tool for customer engagement.

The readers, once they have build up a destination wish list and are ready to travel, can use the provided trip planner in the bloggers pages to make a plan for their holidays. The trip planner offers the ability to book transport, accommodation and activities using affiliate links from the trip planner itself. On paid plans, the blogger can set up their own affiliate codes.

I think Wish To Go can help Travel Bloggers in several ways:

- Engage visitors as it is offering an added value.
	
	The plugin installs the wish list and the trip planner as a feature of their blog. Readers do not have to leave the blog to use them.

- Low friction reader's email acquisition.

	Readers understand that, to have a private wish list, they have to enter some kind of user identification and the email sounds as the natural choice. No need to offer free travel guides or other stuff to get the visitors's email.

- They will know when a reader is ready to travel and where.

	When the readers start using the trip planner, it is likely they are ready to travel and spend on bookings and travel items. All marketing related efforts are more efficient at this time.

- The travel affiliate marketing is focused on one place.

	Most affiliate conversions are lost because there is a long period of time from when the visitor reads a post and when decides to travel. When the readers are ready to travel, it's likely they will book through the trip planner because it is very easy to do it. In this way the affiliate links will be visited at the time of purchase and no cookies or unique visitors are lost.

I'm open to hear any form of collaboration that you or your company can offer, ranging from pure advertisement in selected posts in your blog, links, recommendation of Wish To Go to your travel blogger customers up to your company taking duty over all social marketing of Wish To Go. I'm convinced that the success of my company is tied to have someone with huge knowledge of travel blogging in charge of the marketing area in some way.

Hope to hear from you soon,

Sincerely yours
ขอบคุณครับ
