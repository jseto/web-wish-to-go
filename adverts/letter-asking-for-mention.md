Hi,

I've just read your article about travel blog monetization.

We offer the travel blogger community a destination wish list that can be easily implemented in their blog. A destination wish list helps to monetize travel blogs, in the same way as generic wish lists help to monetize other market places. You can see this kind of bookmarking on Amazon, Booking.com or Airbnb.

I don't want to bother you now with more details but if you want to know more, you can [visit our website](https://wish-to-go.com)

I think that our product is interesting for the target audience of the above mentioned post. Therefore, I would like to discuss with you how a mention of our product can be inserted into the article. I'm also interested to know about your fares.

We are open to any other form of collaboration you may consider.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely

Josep Set√≥
