Hi,

I've just seen your travel blog and found that it is very interesting and is quite evident that you put a lot on effort on it. A list, where your readers could bookmark the destinations that they wish to go will make your blog a better and more useful tool for them.

You can see what I mean in the hearts ❤️ that appear next to the articles in [this blog](https://wish-to-go.com/blog/)

I'm sure you would like to have something so cool in your travel blog.

Have you ever wondered why big marketplaces as _Amazon_ use wish list for their products?

Have you ever imagined that your blog could have a wish list? Do you imagine how powerful a destination wish list can be for your blog?

If you think that a destination wish list can be useful for your travel blog and for your readers or want to know why wish lists are a powerful marketing tool, [have a look at this blog entry](https://wish-to-go.com/travel-blog-monetization/destination-wish-list-for-your-travel-blog/).

Thank you for reading

Josep Setó
