# Using _Wish to go_

Wish to go is a wish list for your travel posts. Your readers can mark an entry in your blog as a _Wish to go_ destination by clicking on the heart icon <WishWidget country="TV"></WishWidget> that you can insert in any place of your site. As they continue reading articles in your blog, they keep choosing destinations that they would like to visit. Once they have a collection of destinations in the wish list, they can plan their next trip in the Wish to go Trip Planner.
