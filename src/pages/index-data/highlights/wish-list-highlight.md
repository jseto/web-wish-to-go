## Increase Visitor's Engagement

![Wish List Feature](../../../images/feature-wish-list.min.svg)

### A Plugin to Increase Visitor Engagement

[Wish To Go Plugin](/subscription/?plan=backpacker) implements a **Travel BucketList** that allows your readers to add destinations in the same way you add products in a **wish list**.

Every online store have a wish list. Why a travel blog shouldn't have one? Wish lists are an excellent tool to increase income:

- **Attract new traffic** as you offer an added value to your readers.
- **Increase visitor engagement** as they keep returning to check the wish list.
- **Identify reader's favourite destinations** and suggest other related blog entries or products.
