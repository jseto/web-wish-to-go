# What's "Wish to go"

Wish to go is a wish list for your travel posts. Your readers can mark an entry in your blog as a "Wish to go" destination by clicking on the hear icon <WishWidget country="TH"/> that you can insert in any place of your site. As they continue reading articles in your blog, they keep choosing destinations they would like to visit. Once they have a collection of destinations in the wish list, they can plan their next trip in the Wish to go Trip Planner.
