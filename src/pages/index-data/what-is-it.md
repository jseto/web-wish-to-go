## What's _Wish to go_ plugin

Wish to go is a plugin for travel bloggers that installs a **destination wish list** for your travel posts. It is like a **travel wish list template** but in fact is a widget in your travel blog. Your readers can mark an entry in your blog as a _Wish to go_ destination by clicking on the heart icon <WishWidget country="TV"></WishWidget> that you can insert in any place of your site. As they continue reading articles in your blog, they keep choosing destinations that they would like to visit. Once they have a collection of destinations in their **Travel Bucket List**, they can plan their next trip with the _Wish To Go_ **Trip Planner** available in your **Travel Blog**.
