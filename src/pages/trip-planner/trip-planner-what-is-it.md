# How it works?

Just browse your favourite travel blog. Look for entries with the ***Wish to go*** 
heart <WishWidget country="TV"></WishWidget> and click on them to add to your 
travel _wish list_. You can use your destinations in the travel _wish list_ to
build up your next trip with the **Trip Planer** below.

If your preferred favourite travel blog does not have the ***Wish to go*** heart
in its blog entries, we recommend you to ask the blog owner to implement 
***Wish to go*** in his/her blog. Meanwhile, you can check how the **Trip Planner** works by
browsing our [travel blog demo](/blog).
