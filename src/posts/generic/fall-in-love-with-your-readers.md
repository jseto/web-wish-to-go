# Let Joanna fall in love with your travel posts
![Wishlist](../../images/reading-mobile.jpg)

As every evening, arriving home after a busy day at work, Joanna throes her bag on the kitchen table, opens the cupboard to grab the tea pot and puts water to boil. With the hot tea cup, she sits on her cosy armchair and picks the the iPad next to the window. She looks through the window on a rainy day outside while having the first sip of the tea that her mother brought from Sri Lanka. 

Once again, as every evening after a busy day at work, she has a look at your _travel blog_ in the hope that you have posted your long ago promised article about Wonderland.

Joanna is your most loyal reader. She dreams about her next trip to Wonderland while browsing your blog. But she is still saving money for the next holidays in months to come. 

## Joanna is flirting

Although you made an extra effort on your last post, Joanna is eager to know more and more about Wonderland. She finishes reading your article well before the tea gets cold and after reviewing some key points she is about to betrayal your effort. Joanna types on Google _Wonderland 10 places_ and Google will do the rest. It will take her to a more popular travel blog.

Joanna will keep reading about Wonderland, hoping from travel blog to travel blog until she falls asleep. The next morning she will not remember your excellent post about Wonderland and your effort will vanish in the ocean of the web.

## Joanna is getting money for the trip

As the months pass, Joanna is saving enough money for her dreamed trip. You posted recently an article about tips to visit Wonderland. But this time you want _Joanna to fall in love with your blog forever_. You decided to let Joanna click on your heart ❤️ every time she likes some destination in your post. You give her your post heart, and she gives you her email. The romance is ready.

Joanna is still a bit naughty and will flirt with other blogs. But she always remembers how she clicked on you hearts.

## Holidays at last!

Holiday time has arrived. It has been a long time since that rainy day when Joanna was reading you blog with a tea cup in her hand. Today it's a sunny day and it is time to plan the trip to Wonderland.
