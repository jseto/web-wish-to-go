The city is situated on the banks of the Nervión, a tidal river. The climate in Bilbao is milder than in most other parts of the peninsula, rarely falling below freezing in winter, or rising above 35ºC in summer. There is also more rain, which is a mixed blessing. The green hills of Bilbao are a welcome relief after an extended stay in the dry plains in the south, but planning a day at the beach is more risky. The population of Bilbao proper is just over 372,000, but within the metropolitan area there are over 1,000,000 inhabitants. Bilbao is divided into eight district areas: Deusto, Uribarri, Otxarkoaga/Txurdinaga, Begoña, Ibaiondo, Abando, Rekalde and Basurto/Zorroza.
