San Sebastian boasts one of the best in-city beaches in Europe. It is quite unusual feeling that you can sunbathe and swim right next to major historical buildings and churches. Surfers are in abundance here.

The city is quite small and cozy, featuring many fish restaurants, several beaches, tons of pintxos bars and a choice of designer clothes shops.

## Things to Do

  - **Beach** - there are two main beaches, one on either side of the
    river.
      - **La Concha**	<WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="La Concha" picture="https://wikitravel.org/upload/en/thumb/1/19/SanSebastian_PaseoDeLaConcha.jpg/320px-SanSebastian_PaseoDeLaConcha.jpg"></WishWidget>, on the west side is the larger, is protected from
        the sea and has an island and boats in the bay. **Ondarreta** <WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="Ondarreta"></WishWidget> is
        in the same bay as La Concha, but split by *El pico del Loro* (a
        rocky outcropping). La Concha and Ondarreta has umbrellas, tents
        and lounge chairs for €15 per day; free WC, showers and changing
        rooms. A team of fully-equipped life-guards are there during the
        daytime.
      - **La Zurriola** <WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="La Zurriola"></WishWidget> to the east of the old town and river is a surf  beach, clearly better if you want waves or beach sports.


  - <WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="Surfing"></WishWidget>**Surfing** - surfboards and bodyboards can be rented on Zurriola
    beach. You'll probably want to spring for a wetsuit as well. The
    surf shop also offers surf lessons (around €65 per person for five
    one-hour lessons in a small group)
