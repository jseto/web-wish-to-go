# A Wish List for your Travel Blog

A _destination wish list_ is an engine (in a plugin or piece of HTML code form) installed in your travel blog which allows your readers to bookmark posts or destinations that appear in them. Think about Instagram. When you click the heart, you are saying that you like the picture. 

Now imagine that instead of _liking_ pictures, what you _like_ are destinations in your blog. Clicking on the heart next to a travel post, means that the reader like that destination. In the future, when readers are ready to travel, they can go back to have a look at the _liked_ destinations and build up a trip plan tailored to their tastes expressed through their clicks on the hearts inserted in the posts.

The idea of a wish list is widely used in big marketplaces as _Amazon_ which use wish list for their products. Recently, travel related sites like _Booking.com_ or _Airbnb_ have also implemented such feature.
