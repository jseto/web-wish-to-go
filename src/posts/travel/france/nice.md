# Nice
<WishWidget country="FR" city="Nice" label="true"></WishWidget>

Nice is a large city in France on the French Riviera. It's a popular destination for tourists, both young and old, with something to offer nearly everyone. It is well known for the beautiful view on the *Promenade des Anglais*, its famous waterfront, and is an ethnically diverse port city.

## What to see

The **Colline du Chateau** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Nice" activity="Colline du Chateau"></WishWidget> overlooking the _Baie des Anges_ and harbour offers a spectacular vantage point overlooking the city. Not much is left of its ruined castle besides crumbling walls. Still, climbing up the stairs to reach the platforms 90 metres above Nice is well worth the view. There is also an *ascenseur* (lift) which will take you three quarters of the way up. Be aware that the castle _park_ closes at around
sunset. Expect to be escorted outside if you stay longer.

### Museums

Nice is also known for several museums, entry to most of which (as of July 2008) is free. Some of the most famous are in Cimiez, the older, upper part of the city which in a previous century was a favourite of Queen Victoria, including:

### The Beaches

If you go to Nice for bathing or general lounging on the beach, you may wish to think again. The beaches of Nice consist entirely of large flat stones (_gallets_).

Much nicer beaches exist in other towns close by, such as **Villefranche-sur-Mer** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Nice" activity="Villefranche-sur-Mer"></WishWidget>, **Antibes** and **Cannes** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Nice" activity="Cannes"></WishWidget>, which are far more sandy. _Villefranche_ is a particularly preferred beach choice, especially if travelling with children, only twenty minutes away by the TAM 100 bus.

### Beautiful Landscapes

For views of Nice the best vantage point is the heights of _Mont Boron_. From the derelict old Fort and the nearby villa of Sir Elton John there are fine views over the city to the mountains and east over _Villefranche_ and **Cap Ferat** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Nice" activity="Cap Ferrat"></WishWidget>.

Go to **Eze** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Nice" activity="Eze"></WishWidget>. It is a small village on the way to Monaco. The village is situated on a small mountain and there is a beautiful cactus garden with a spectacular view (a must-see, â‚¬6 entrance fee). Unfortunately the old town is fully commercialized with restaurants, souvenir shops, and art galleries.
