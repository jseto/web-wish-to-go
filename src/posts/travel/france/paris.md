Paris, the cosmopolitan capital of France, is one Europe's largest cities, with 2.2 million people living in the dense, central city and almost 12 million people living in the whole metropolitan area. Located in the north of France on the river Seine, Paris has the well-deserved reputation of being the most beautiful and romantic of all cities, brimming with historic associations and remaining vastly influential in the realms of culture, art, fashion, food and design. Dubbed the City of Light (_La Ville Lumière_) and Capital of Fashion, it is home to the world's finest and most luxurious fashion designers and cosmetics.

## Things to do

- **Château de Versailles (Versailles)** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Paris" activity="Vesailles" post="/france/paris/#things-to-do"></WishWidget>

	Must be seen. France's most exquisite chateau, on the outskirts of the city, easily visited by train. Once the home to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.

- **Notre Dame Cathedral** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Paris" activity="Notre Dame" post="/france/paris/#things-to-do" picture="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1576653764709-7d175299e6d9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60"></WishWidget>

	Impressive Gothic cathedral that was the inspiration for Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Climb to the top!

- **The Louvre** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Paris" activity="Louvre"></WishWidget>

	One of the finest museums in the world. Home of the Mona Lisa and innumerable others. Enormous building and collection, plan at least two visits.

- **Eiffel Tower** <WishWidget country="FR" city="Paris" activity="Eiffel" picture="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565881606991-789a8dff9dbb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" post="/france/paris/#things-to-do"></WishWidget>

	A symbol of Paris and one of the most famous landmarks in the world. Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. Note that the queues can be very long. The Tower has recently begun allowing online reservations at its website, allowing visitors the choice of a date and time frame.
