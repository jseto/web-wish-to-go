# Strasbourg
<WishWidget country="FR" city="Strasbourg" label="true"></WishWidget>

Strasbourg is the capital of the Alsace region of France and is most widely known for hosting a number of important European institutions. It is also famous for its beautiful historical centre - the Grande Île - which was the first city centre to be classified entirely as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

	Petite France is the name given to the small area between the rivers, just south of the Grande Île. It is home to some of Strasbourg's prettiest and most photogenic streets and buildings, with half-timbered townhouses (*maisons à colombage*) leaning out over the narrow cobbled streets.
