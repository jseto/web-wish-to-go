The city is situated on the banks of the _Nervión_, a tidal river. The climate in Bilbao is milder than in most other parts of the peninsula, rarely falling below freezing in winter, or rising above 35ºC in summer. There is also more rain, which is a mixed blessing. The green hills of Bilbao are a welcome relief after an extended stay in the dry plains in the south, but planning a day at the beach is more risky. The population of Bilbao proper is just over 372,000, but within the metropolitan area there are over 1,000,000 inhabitants. Bilbao is divided into eight district areas: _Deusto_, _Uribarri_, _Otxarkoaga_/_Txurdinaga_, _Begoña_, _Ibaiondo_, _Abando_, _Rekalde_ and _Basurto_/_Zorroza_.

This plaza was the seat of the _Diputación de Vizcaya_ until July 1900 when the _Diputación_ moved to its new home on the _Gran Vía_.
