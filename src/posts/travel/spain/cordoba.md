# Cordoba
<WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" label="true"></WishWidget>

![Cordoba](https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/0/0f/Belltower_street_cordoba.jpg/300px-Belltower_street_cordoba.jpg)

Cordoba is a mid-sized city of 350,000 inhabitants and the capital of the province of Cordoba, situated in the centre of *Andalucia* in Spain. A great cultural reference point in Europe, this ancient city has been declared a World Heritage Site and contains a mixture of the diverse cultures that have settled it throughout history.

## The Mezquita

The biggest attraction in Cordoba and a truly must-see building, the Mezquita is a massive former mosque-turned-cathedral famed for its “forest” of columns topped with Islamic-style red and white striped arches among its other many architectural highlights and serves as a reminder of the glory and importance Cordoba held in medieval times. The building is full of history and beauty - you'll want to give yourself at least a couple of hours to do it justice.

Stepping through one of the doors you'll enter the **Patio de los Naranjos** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Patio de los Naranjos"></WishWidget>, or Court of the Oranges, which true to its name contains a grove of orange trees, planted in symmetrical rows that replicate the forest of columns within the building. A large fountain drips pleasantly in the middle, and the views of the bell tower framed by trees are excellent. The Patio is free to enter and is open during the day as a public park - the ticket booths are located on the bell tower side of the courtyard.

Opposite the room from the entrance is the **Mihrab** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Mihrab"></WishWidget>, a spectacular archway decorated with Arabic writing which was the focus of the mosque, as it faced in the direction of Mecca and was what every Muslim faced as they knelt on the floor to pray. Once, tens of thousands of people could fit into this space to pray, the multitude knelt on their rugs before the _Mihrab_. In the corner of the building nearby are glass cases with artefacts excavated from beneath the _Mezquita_, and the walls along the side of the building are lined with chapels, each one with an intricate piece of artwork.

At the centre of the building, the **Cathedral** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Cathedral"></WishWidget> towers over the rest of the building, and the transition from the impressive-but-intimate mosque structure to the overwhelming awe of the cathedral is abrupt and rather jarring, but don't let that stop you from taking in the beauty of the cathedral, with its rich decoration and well-illuminated interior, standing to suggest triumph over the Muslims who previously used this building. The presence of the cathedral also offers the unique opportunity to so easily compare the differences between Muslim and Christian architecture.

### The Old City

A tangle of narrow medieval streets surrounding the _Mezquita_, the Old City sits just uphill from the muddy Guadalquivir River and contains the vast majority of Cordoba's tourist attractions. North and west of the _Mezquita_ sits the **Jewish Quarter**, a neighbourhood which dates from the late Middle Ages and offers an interesting stroll, some lovely patios and a few scant reminders of the Jewish population that once lived here.

- **Puente Romano** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Puente Romano" label="true"></WishWidget>

	A Roman-style bridge over the shallow Guadalquivir River that was once the main crossing over the river, securing Cordoba's importance to the region. The entrance to the bridge is marked by a triumphal arch and an adjacent single-column monument and it crosses to an old fortified gate (now a museum, described below) on the other side.

- **Museum of Al-Andalus Life** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Museum of Al-Andalus Life"></WishWidget>

  A history museum located in the _Torre de la Calahorra_, which once served as the old fortified gate to the city. Upon entering the museum the greeters (who speak good English) have you don a headset which will explain the exhibits and artefacts on Muslim Andalusia you will view as you walk from room to room. The artefacts are worth a look and the balcony on the top of the tower offers an excellent view of the river and the city.

- **Alcazar de los Reyes Cristianos** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Alcazar de los Reyes Cristianos"></WishWidget>

	Built in the 8th century as a caliphate residence on the site of a Visigoth fortress, the Alcazar was used as the residence and fortress of Ferdinand and Isabella (the “Christian Monarchs” for whom the building is now named) as well as a headquarters for the Spanish Inquisition. The fortress, with its artifacts (including a series of Roman mosaics and a Roman sarcophagus) and two towers is now open for touring, but the main attraction here is the lush and beautiful gardens on the site.

### Outside the Old City

- **Plaza del Cristo de los Faroles** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Cristo de los faroles"></WishWidget>

	_Cuesta del Bailio_ (Close to _Alfaros_ street). The most impressive square, the best time to go there is the sunset or night (see picture). A Christ in the Cross statue adorned with lot of old lanterns, candles and flowers in a very quiet atmosphere.

- **Madina Azahara** <WishWidget country="ES" city="Cordoba" activity="Medina Azahara"></WishWidget>

  Ruins of the capital of the Western Caliphate, built beginning in 940. Huge archaeological interest, a beautiful and very special walk. Approximately 5 km west of town. (Free entrance for EU-citizens, very cheap for non-EU.) The tourism office currently runs a bus at 10:15AM / 5PM for 7 Euro. Note that there are no local buses running to the _Madinat_, but you can take a taxi there and then ask the Museum staff to order a taxi for you when you need to head back to Cordoba city centre.
