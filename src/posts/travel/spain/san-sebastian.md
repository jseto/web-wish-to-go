San Sebastian boasts one of the best in-city beaches in Europe. It is quite unusual feeling that you can sunbathe and swim right next to major historical buildings and churches. Surfers are in abundance here.

The city is quite small and cosy, featuring many fish restaurants, several beaches, tons of _pintxo_ bars and a choice of designer clothes shops.

## Things to Do

### The Beach

There are two main beaches, one on either side of the river.

- **La Concha**	<WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="La Concha" picture="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541696600154-297b00782a04?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80"></WishWidget>, on the west side is the larger, is protected from the sea and has an island and boats in the bay.

- **Ondarreta** <WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="Ondarreta"></WishWidget>is in the same bay as La Concha, but split by *El pico del Loro* (a rocky outcropping). _La Concha_ and _Ondarreta_ have umbrellas, tents and lounge chairs for €15 per day; free WC, showers and changing rooms. A team of fully-equipped life-guards are there during the daytime.

- **La Zurriola** <WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="La Zurriola"></WishWidget>to the east of the old town and river is a surf beach, clearly better if you want waves or beach sports.
Surfboards and bodyboards can be rented on _Zurriola_ beach. You'll probably want to spring for a wetsuit as well. The surf shop also offers surf lessons <WishWidget	country="ES" city="San Sebastian"	activity="Surfing"></WishWidget>(around €65 per person for five one-hour lessons in a small group).
