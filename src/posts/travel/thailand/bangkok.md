Bangkok, official name _Krung Thep Maha Nakhon_, is the capital of Thailand and, with a population of over eleven million inhabitants, by far its largest city. Its high-rise buildings, heavy traffic congestion, intense heat and naughty nightlife may not immediately give you the best impression — but don't let that mislead you. It is one of Asia's most cosmopolitan cities with magnificent temples and palaces, authentic canals, busy markets and a vibrant nightlife that has something for everyone.

For years, it was only a small trading post at the banks of the _Chao Phraya_ River, until King Rama I, the first monarch of the present _Chakri_ dynasty, turned it into the capital of Siam in 1782, after the burning of _Ayutthaya_ by Burmese invaders, but they did not take over _Ayutthaya_. Since then, Bangkok has turned into a national treasure house and functions as Thailand's spiritual, cultural, political, commercial, educational and diplomatic centre.

From the moment you arrive, Bangkok is an invigorating assault on the senses. The heat, the noise, and the smells will leave you reeling if you're not used to the insanity of Asia's mega cities. It certainly is not a destination that many people will forget in a hurry.

## What to see

### Grand Palace and Emerald Bhuda

Bangkok's most popular tourist attraction, the Grand Palace is the former residence of the King and is built adjacent to, and more or less integrated with _Wat Phra Kaew_ (also known as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha). The palace was originally built together with the establishment of Bangkok by King Rama I and has been expanded ever since. It covers a wide range of architectural styles, ranging from the pure _Ayutthayan_ style of the temples to a blend of Thai and Western styles for later structures. While the King no longer lives here, a large part of the complex is used for royal residences and ceremonies and is off-limits to tourists.

_Wat Phra Kaew_, the Temple of Emerald Buddha, is the most sacred Buddhist temple of Thailand. While construction of the temple was completed in 1784, it has a sanitized appearance as if it was built only yesterday. The temple houses a diminutive jade statue, the Emerald Buddha, of uncertain but long provenance and revered as the symbol of the Thai state. According to the legend, it was created in India in 43 BC after which it was taken to Sri Lanka, Cambodia and eventually Siam. Art historians, however, describe the statue as belonging to the _Chiang Saen_ style of the 15th century, concluding it must have originally come from _Lanna_ (current Northern Thailand). It was taken to _Luang Prabang_ in the current state of Laos in 1552, and moved to Vientiane twelve years later. In 1779, in the _Thonburi Period_, General _Chao Phraya Chakri_ captured Vientiane and returned the Emerald Buddha to Siam. When he was crowned as King Rama I, he moved the Emerald Buddha to its current location in _Rattanakosin_. Visitors line up around the building for a chance to walk by the Emerald Buddha with offerings of lilies and incense. You must take off your shoes before entering the bot, and taking pictures inside is not allowed. Also, show respect by sitting with your feet pointing away from the Buddha. The Buddha's clothing is changed three times a year depending on the season; you can see the other outfits in the Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Thai Coins after the tour.

### Wat Pho

**Wat Pho**, popularly known as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha, is the largest temple of Bangkok, and probably the oldest too, as it predates the founding of the capital by about 200 years. Most foreign travellers come for the much-needed picture of themselves with the enormous Reclining Buddha; it is the largest reclining Buddha image in Thailand, and possibly the largest in the world. The list of records doesn't end there; _Wat Pho_ is home to more than one thousand Buddha images, more than any other temple in the country. The temple as it appears now comes from the late 18th century, right after the founding of _Rattanakosin_, when King Rama I almost completely rebuilt the complex. He renamed the temple _Wat Phra Chetuphon_, as Thais still call it today, but the new name never really caught on in the West. Another major revamp took place in 1832, when in the reign of King Rama III new chapels were added and walls and pillars were decorated with inscriptions on traditional medicine. **Wat Pho** is often cited as Thailand's first university, as even before the temple's founding, the site was a centre of education for traditional Thai medicine.

### Wat Arun

**Wat Arun**, also known as the Temple of Dawn, is an iconic temple at the west bank of the _Chao Phraya_ River, right next to the Navy Base. This is a royal temple in the highest rank and it is by far the most visited tourist attraction in _Thonburi_. It is easily accessible with the 3 baht ferry boat from _Wat Pho_ in _Rattanakosin_. Ferries take off about every 10 to 15 minutes and operate daily from 06:00 till about 22:00. Walking around the temple gardens and looking at it from a distance is free, but if you want to enter the temple compound and climb the steep stairs, it costs 50 baht (for foreigners at least). Entering the complex can be recommended, as otherwise you won't see the small porcelain pieces it is decorated with. The temple grounds are opened from 07:30 till 17:30. Thousands of foreign tourists visit the temple every day, many of them by canal tour early in the morning.

## What to do

- **Canal Tour** <WishWidget country="TH"

	![Canal Tour](https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/0/05/DSC04039_copy.JPG/350px-DSC04039_copy.JPG)

	A great way to see the _Chao Phraya__ River_ and the original canals of the city is by canal tour. Most of these special boat trips start at the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and head through the backwaters of _Thonburi_, taking in Wat Arun, the Royal Barges National Museum and a floating market. More information about these canal tours can be found in the _Thonburi_ article. At 1,000 baht or more, they are quite expensive though; a cheaper and also fun activity is to take the public express boat along the Chao Phraya River. You can get off anywhere between Thewet and Sathon (_Taksin_) piers as there are many things to see in all those neighbourhoods. You can even go all the way north to _Nonthaburi_ in the morning, enjoy the afternoon in this laid-back traditional urban town and take the boat back around rush hour.

	![Food Tour](https://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/bangkok/portals/bangkok-com/homepage/food-top10/pagePropertiesImage/thai-som-tum.jpg)

	Thailand’s food needs little introduction. From San Francisco to _Sukhothai_, its profusion of exotic flavours and fragrances make it among the most coveted of international cuisines. As a walk through Bangkok forcefully reminds, these flavours and fragrances are seemingly inexhaustible. However, whether it be juicy pieces of grilled pork on a stick or a fiery bowl of ‘Tom Yum’ soup, we all have to start somewhere. And what better place than our carefully selected Top 10 of Thai Food, which spans everything from staple backpacker favourites to Thai classics.

	Thai Cooking School is glad to bring you in a typical Thaï market for a tour. This tour is not a quick tour to show you what a market looks like, it’s much more than that! Indeed, we have decided to make you discover a real Thai market attended by only Thaï people and where you are going to find every fresh product we will need for cooking.

	![Chatuchak Market](https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/1/15/Weekend_market_bangkok.jpg/350px-Weekend_market_bangkok.jpg)

	Northern Bangkok's biggest draw is the Chatuchak Weekend Market, Sa-Su 09:00-18:00, +66 2 272-4441), an incredibly vast, 35-acre indoor and outdoor market that has more than 8,000 vendors selling anything and everything under the sun. To put that number in perspective, if you browsed every stall one minute each, non-stop for eight hours on every Saturday and Sunday, it would take you around two months to visit them all! A good rule of thumb is to buy immediately if you spot something interesting, as you will never find that same stall again.

## Bangkok Outskirts

	![Amphawa](https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/0/05/DSC04039_copy.JPG/350px-DSC04039_copy.JPG)

	The canal-side way of life in Amphawa takes place along the waterfront walkways of Amphawa Canal, a small tributary of the _Mae Khlong_ River. Every weekend Thais flock to the Amphawa Floating Market, as big queues emerge along the canal's bridges and walkways. While commercially developed, the old wooden houses and shopfronts retain some of their original charm.

	In the _Ayutthaya_ Period, Amphawa was called _Khwaeng Bang Chang_, a small community that flourished in agriculture and trade. Sources have confirmed the existence of a market here since the reign of King _Prasat Thong_ in the mid-seventeenth century. In 1766, King Rama II was born in Amphawa, his mother's hometown, as his father was ruling the town of _Ratchaburi_. At his probable birthplace is now the King Rama II Memorial Park.
